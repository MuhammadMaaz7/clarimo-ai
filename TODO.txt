embeddings should be used
saved in global
if similar context data, then used 

test with 2 similar inputs

remove user1,2,3,4

what is global cache, and optimized global cache


what is exact, normalized, semantic


what is the purpose of this exact, normalized, semantic

how will it work?

now lets start doing testing first from frontend whole pipeline

llets let me input smth like, apps for personal gym training

Smth like this

when all of this steps are done from user oinput till clustering, then

i will enter another input similar to it, not same, so we can test the embeddings cache are being used or not?



for testing, change first priority to semantic hits, so we can check if it is hitting semantically or not? working correctly or not?
