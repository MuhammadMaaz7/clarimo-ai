=> Competitor Weaknesses in market analysis 
=> Dashboard
=> Unified the frontend, theme, color scheme, all components, like loading spinner is differnt in loading previous ideas, and same of previous pain points, and comppetitor analysis, the pop ups, the toast messages, should be unified, the website shouldnt like rainbow, the color scheme of the website which is that should be used, with different effect, shades, glass effects and modern look, the idea validation effects, colors looks good, mmake the commplete system unified in frontend. and reuse the components, do less duplication, if one component is already there and could be used then use that instead of making new
=> IDEA VALIDATION MORE METRICS




Where the are the competitor analysis user inputs being saved? and in the previous competitor analysis, i cant see user inputs with the analysis, aas i can see in the idea validaation, and pain point discovery, show the inputs of that analysis too, interactively, and user inputs must be saved in the db
and at every step of backend in competitor anlysis, all the data in between all the steps MUST be saved in the data directory in side the backend
