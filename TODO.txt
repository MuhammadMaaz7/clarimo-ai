# TODO - Clarimo AI

## Module 1 - Pain Point Discovery
- Embeddings should be used and saved in global cache
- Test with 2 similar inputs to verify cache is working
- Remove user1,2,3,4 test data
- Understand global cache vs optimized global cache
- Understand exact, normalized, semantic matching
- Change priority to semantic hits for testing
- Text color improvements in UI
- Display only problems (remove upvotes display)
- UI improvements needed
- Save pain points in database
- User should see their inputs and corresponding pain points in profile/UI
- Input validation with prompt in keyword extraction
- UI improvements: loading spinner, better design
- Use domain in filtering
- Output should not be removed until user removes in frontend
- Proper logging: total time, separate time tracking
- Remove session management for now
- Remove "TRUNCATED" display in frontend posts
- Processing status should show "completed"
- Any limit on reference inputs?

## Module 2 - Idea Validation
- Only 1 paragraph input - system should extract all required info automatically
  (Currently taking multiple inputs, should be extracted from single description)

## Recent Fixes (2025-11-30)
✅ Fixed validation bugs - inconsistent Score class definitions
✅ Fixed LLM prompt ambiguity in risk assessor
✅ Fixed continuous polling after validation completes
✅ Fixed ideas not showing validation status in UI

Recommendations should not be hardcoded
Something other than only LLM calls

## Module 3 - Competitor Analysis (2025-12-07)

✅ DONE - Simplified to 3 clear tabs:
- TAB 1: COMPETITORS - Clean list with real data, pricing, features
- TAB 2: FEATURE COMPARISON - Only shows if real data exists, otherwise shows "Limited data" message
- TAB 3: MARKET ANALYSIS - Honest assessment with challenges, opportunities, recommendations

✅ DONE - Removed bias and fake metrics:
- Removed fake "unique strengths" that just repeated user input
- Removed misleading metric cards (opportunities count, strengths count)
- LLM prompts now explicitly demand honest, factual analysis
- Temperature lowered to 0.1 for more factual responses
- Will tell user if market is saturated or they have no real advantages
- Feature comparison only shows when we have actual scraped data

✅ DONE - Fixed search relevance (finding wrong competitors):
- Keyword extractor now preserves meaningful PHRASES instead of single words
  Example: "CodeSnippetVault" -> "code snippet manager" (not just "code", "snippet")
- Search queries now combine keywords to form product categories
  Example: "code snippet software" instead of "code software"
- Filters out generic terms (app, software, tool, platform) from single-word searches
- Added SEMANTIC FILTERING using TF-IDF + cosine similarity
  * Compares competitor descriptions to user's product description
  * Automatically filters out irrelevant results (e.g., VS Code when searching for snippet managers)
  * No hardcoded rules - uses ML to determine relevance
  * Minimum similarity threshold: 0.15 (adjustable)
  * Ranks by: relevance_score × semantic_similarity
