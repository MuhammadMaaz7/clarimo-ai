# TODO - Clarimo AI

## Module 1 - Pain Point Discovery
- Embeddings should be used and saved in global cache
- Test with 2 similar inputs to verify cache is working
- Remove user1,2,3,4 test data
- Understand global cache vs optimized global cache
- Understand exact, normalized, semantic matching
- Change priority to semantic hits for testing
- Text color improvements in UI
- Display only problems (remove upvotes display)
- UI improvements needed
- Save pain points in database
- User should see their inputs and corresponding pain points in profile/UI
- Input validation with prompt in keyword extraction
- UI improvements: loading spinner, better design
- Use domain in filtering
- Output should not be removed until user removes in frontend
- Proper logging: total time, separate time tracking
- Remove session management for now
- Remove "TRUNCATED" display in frontend posts
- Processing status should show "completed"
- Any limit on reference inputs?

## Module 2 - Idea Validation
- Only 1 paragraph input - system should extract all required info automatically
  (Currently taking multiple inputs, should be extracted from single description)

## Recent Fixes (2025-11-30)
✅ Fixed validation bugs - inconsistent Score class definitions
✅ Fixed LLM prompt ambiguity in risk assessor
✅ Fixed continuous polling after validation completes
✅ Fixed ideas not showing validation status in UI

Recommendations should not be hardcoded
Something other than only LLM calls
